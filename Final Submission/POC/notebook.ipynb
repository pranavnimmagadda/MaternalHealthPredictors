    "# Pregnancy Risk Prediction: Evaluation Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook provides a comprehensive and professional overview of the machine learning pipeline for predicting **high-risk pregnancy** and **premature birth risk** using Random Forest models on Telangana maternal health data. It details data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and clinical integration, emphasizing methodological transparency and rigor. The pipeline leverages a robust feature engineering strategy to enhance predictive performance, as outlined in the provided document (\"Feature Engineering List - Telangana Maternal Health\").\n",

    "### Objective\n",
    "Efficiently load large-scale maternal health data for subsequent preprocessing and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "- **Loading Mechanism**: Utilized `pyarrow.parquet` for memory-efficient batch processing.\n",
    "  - **Batch Size**: 10,000 rows per batch to balance memory usage and processing speed.\n",
    "  - **Total Rows**: Determined dynamically using Parquet metadata.\n",
    "- **Key Columns**:\n",
    "  - **Required**: `MOTHER_ID` (unique identifier), `GRAVIDA` (number of pregnancies).\n",
    "  - **Numeric Features**: `AGE`, `AGE_preg`, `AGE_final`, `GRAVIDA`, `PARITY`, `ABORTIONS`, `TOTAL_ANC_VISITS`, `HEMOGLOBIN_mean`, `HEMOGLOBIN_min`, `WEIGHT_max`, `HEIGHT`, `PHQ_SCORE_max`, `GAD_SCORE_max`, `WEIGHT_last`, `WEIGHT_first`, `NO_OF_WEEKS_max`, `WEIGHT_min`, `WEIGHT_mean`.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "  - **GRAVIDA Handling**: Converted `GRAVIDA` to numeric, replacing invalid entries ('nan', non-numeric) with NaN and filling with 0, as 0 is a clinically plausible default.\n",
    "  - **Flag Mapping**: Applied a `flag_map` to categorical flags (`IS_CHILD_DEATH`, `IS_DEFECTIVE_BIRTH`):\n",
    "    - 'Y', 'YES', 'Yes', 'y', 'yes' → 1\n",
    "    - 'N', 'NO', 'No', 'n', 'no' → 0\n",
    "    - None, 'None', '', 'nan' → NaN\n",
    "  - **Numeric Columns**: Converted columns (`AGE`, `HEMOGLOBIN_mean`, etc.) to numeric using `pd.to_numeric`, coercing non-numeric values to NaN and filling with 0.\n",
    "  - **Debugging**: Logged non-numeric values in numeric columns to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "- **Feature Exclusion**:\n",
    "  - **Leakage Prevention**: Excluded columns that could introduce leakage, including:\n",

    "  - **Additional Exclusions**: Removed `MISSANC1FLG` to `MISSANC4FLG`, `HIGH_RISKS`, and columns with 'risk' or 'score' in their names (except `mental_health_risk`) to ensure generalizability.\n",
    "- **Stratified Sampling**:\n",
    "  - **Function**: `create_stratified_sample` generated a 2,000,000-record sample.\n",
    "  - **Prioritization**: Included all records with `IS_CHILD_DEATH` == 1, `maternal_mortality_risk` == 1, or `stillbirth_risk` == 1 to capture rare, high-severity outcomes.\n",
    "  - **Balancing**: Randomly sampled remaining records to reach the target size, stratified by the target column (`high_risk_pregnancy` or `premature_birth_risk`).\n",

    "The pipeline delivers robust predictions for high-risk pregnancy (AUC: 0.9852, F1: 0.9691) and premature birth risk (AUC: 0.9601, F1: 0.9173), driven by features like `HEMOGLOBIN_mean` and `anemia_moderate`. The clinical support system enhances real-world utility. Future work could involve hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, or expanded feature engineering to capture temporal trends."
